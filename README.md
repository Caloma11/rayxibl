# Future TODO List

- In `/profiles`, AJAXify the tab switch (My network & Everyone buttons)
- When pressing "add to network" (user plus icon) in `/profiles`, AJAXify it so that it gets added instantly in the "My network" section

- Ajaxify loading of profiles on `profiles#index` 

  More on point 2 (nice to have behaviours):

  - It should not disappear right away in the "Everyone" section
  - Newly added person should show up when switching to "My network"
  - When switching back to "Everyone" tab, person should already disappear

- As a freelancer, when you're already in the network of a company, you don't see their job postings under `/jobs` anymore
