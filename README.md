# Future TODO List

- ~~In `/profiles`, AJAXify the tab switch (My networe buttons)~~
- ~~In `/profiles/:id`, AJAXify the tab switch (About, Links & Notes)~~
- ~~When pressing "add to network" (user plus icon) in `/profiles`, AJAXify it so that it gets added instantly in the "My network" section~~

- ~~Ajaxify loading of profiles on `profiles#index`~~
- ~~Ajaxify adding to network on `profiles#show`~~
- Jobs#new page styling
- Notifications system
- Archiving jobs system -> (Is it there on both sides ?)

  ~~More on point 2 (nice to have behaviours):~~

  - ~~It should not disappear right away in the "Everyone" section~~
  - ~~Newly added person should show up when switching to "My network"~~
  - ~~When switching back to "Everyone" tab, person should already disappear~~

- ~~As a freelancer, when you're already in the network of a company, you don't see their job postings under `/jobs` anymore~~

- Purge CSS for production
- Use Cloudflare as asset hoster
- Add Accept/Reject booking in the widget (triple dot icon)
